	abstractNote= "Nowadays, short message service (SMS) is being used in many daily life applications, including healthcare monitoring, mobile banking, mobile commerce, and so on. But when we send an SMS from one mobile phone to another, the information contained in the SMS transmit as plain text. Sometimes this information may be confidential like account numbers, passwords, license numbers, and so on, and it is a major drawback to send such information through SMS while the traditional SMS service does not provide encryption to the information before its transmission. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure protocol called EasySMS, which provides end-to-end secure communication through SMS between end users. The working of the protocol is presented by considering two different scenarios. The analysis of the proposed protocol shows that this protocol is able to prevent various attacks, including SMS disclosure, over the air modification, replay attack, man-in-the-middle attack, and impersonation attack. The EasySMS protocol generates minimum communication and computation overheads as compared with existing SMSSec and PK-SIM protocols. On an average, the EasySMS protocol reduces 51% and 31% of the bandwidth consumption and reduces 62% and 45% of message exchanged during the authentication process in comparison to SMSSec and PK-SIM protocols respectively. Authors claim that EasySMS is the first protocol completely based on the symmetric key cryptography and retain original architecture of cellular network.",

Results support the notion that managers from the European Union, Japan, and the United States will be more likely to adopt SMS advertising if they perceive it has the ability to help build the brand. They are also likely to perceive information security as a threat to the ability to “push” the product through the wireless channel.

However, in literature, the existing m-government architecture in Africa does not adequately consider security in its feature.

The adoptable framework has four major components, namely: m-government administration, security/privacy, m-services and m-participation/trust. A secure platform for this SMS transmission based on multicast encryption system is presented with some policies to guide its adoption. A prototype of the proposed design is implemented on a peer-peer platform in order to display the uniqueness of the framework. To examine the readiness of the population for its adoption in Nigeria, this paper analyses the use of the technological acceptance model. Seventy questionnaires were administered to citizens, measuring their responses to perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), attitudes towards usage (ATU) and behavioural intention to use (BIU) the mobile system. The results of the study indicated that citizens’ PEOU had a significant influence on ATU. Subsequently, PEOU had the strongest significant influence on PU.

	abstractNote= "Two-factor authentication is a method of security that adds an extra layer of protection by requiring users to have two different authentication factors to verify identity. In recent years, institutions and organizations have become more concerned with the security aspects of their networks and systems, and one of these aspects is ensuring that the individual seeking access to the system is who he claims to be. With the advancement in technology and science over time, it has been seen that the safety and security of sensitive information or data transferred over the internet from one network to another has become increasingly relevant. The reliance on access to login accounts and the use of static passwords makes it easy for hackers, identity thieves, and fraudsters to gain access. Therefore, there is a need to find solutions to overcome the weaknesses to provide a more secure environment, hence, adding another step of authentication to individual identity makes it more difficult for an attacker to gain access to personal data. The proposed system generates dynamic password (OTP), which helps to add another level of security to the system against Dictionary attack, Brute-force attack especially Perfect-Man-In-The-Middle attack. The project used the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) e-portal login system as a case study. The system was implemented using the MySQL, CSS, HTML and PHP programming language and evaluated using reliability, effectiveness, efficiency, usability, expediency, and satisfactoriness as metrics. A questionnaire was formulated using a rating scale of 1 - 5, with 1 representing extremely poor and 5 representing excellent. The questionnaire was given to twenty (20) randomly selected students of OAU. The average score was determined and all the metrics scored higher than 4.0, which signifies a good rating. The system developed is a useful starting point for future development in security applications that require two-factor authentication. The result show that with the developed system, it can be assured that all logins are legitimate and that users are safe by verifying that the individual seeking access to the system is who he claims to be. A more user-friendly GUI is planned for the future and expanding the OTP algorithm such that password can be generated based on different cryptographic functions.",

In this contribution we enhance the ciphertext-only attack [2] by Barkan, Biham, and Keller by designing special-purpose hardware for generating and solving the required systems of linear equations. For realizing the LSE solver component, we use an approach recently introduced in [5,6] describing a parallelized hardware implementation of the Gauss-Jordan algorithm. Our hardware-only attacker immediately recovers the initial secret state of A5/2 - which is sufficient for decrypting all frames of a session - using a few ciphertext frames without any precomputations and memory. More precisely, in contrast to [2] our hardware architecture directly attacks the GSM speech channel (TCH/FS and TCH/EFS). It requires 16 ciphertext frames and completes the attack in about 1 second. With minor changes also input from other GSM channels (e.g., SDCCH/8) can be used to mount the attack. ",

    abstractNote= "The privacy of most GSM phone conversations is currently protected by the 20+ years old A5/1 and A5/2 stream ciphers, which were repeatedly shown to be cryptographically weak. They will soon be replaced in third generation networks by a new A5/3 block cipher called KASUMI, which is a modified version of the MISTY cryptosystem. In this paper we describe a new type of attack called a sandwich attack, and use it to construct a simple distinguisher for 7 of the 8 rounds of KASUMI with an amazingly high probability of $2^{ -14}$. By using this distinguisher and analyzing the single remaining round, we can derive the complete 128 bit key of the full KASUMI by using only 4 related keys, $2^{26}$ data, $2^{30}$ bytes of memory, and $2^{32}$ time. These complexities are so small that we have actually simulated the attack in less than two hours on a single PC, and experimentally verified its correctness and complexity. Interestingly, neither our technique nor any other published attack can break MISTY in less than the $2^{128}$ complexity of exhaustive search, which indicates that the changes made by the GSM Association in moving from MISTY to KASUMI resulted in a much weaker cryptosystem.",

    abstractNote= "In this paper we present a very practical ciphertext-only cryptanalysis of GSM encrypted communication, and various active attacks on the GSM protocols. These attacks can even break into GSM networks that use “unbreakable” ciphers. We describe a ciphertext-only attack on A5/2 that requires a few dozen milliseconds of encrypted off-the-air cellular conversation and finds the correct key in less than a second on a personal computer. We then extend this attack to a (more complex) ciphertext-only attack on A5/1. We describe new attacks on the protocols of networks that use A5/1, A5/3, or even GPRS. These attacks are based on security flaws of the GSM protocols, and work whenever the mobile phone supports A5/2. We emphasize that these attacks are on the protocols, and are thus applicable whenever the cellular phone supports a weak cipher, for instance they are also applicable using the cryptanalysis of A5/1. Unlike previous attacks on GSM that require unrealistic information, like long known plaintext periods, our attacks are very practical and do not require any knowledge of the content of the conversation. These attacks allow attackers to tap conversations and decrypt them either in real-time, or at any later time. We also show active attacks, such as call hijacking, altering of data messages and call theft.",

 	abstractNote= "The Global Systems for Mobile communications (GSM) is the most widespread mobile communication technology existing nowadays. Despite being a mature technology, its introduction dates back to the late eighties, it suffers from several security vulnerabilities, which have been targeted by many attacks aimed to break the underlying communication protocol. Most of these attacks focuses on the A5/1 algorithm used to protect over-the-air communication between the two parties of a phone call. This algorithm has been superseded by new and more secure algorithms. However, it is still in use in the GSM networks as a fallback option, thus still putting at risk the security of the GSM based conversations. The objective of this work is to review some of the most relevant results in this field and discuss their practical feasibility. To this end, we consider not only the contributions coming from the canonical scientific literature but also those that have been proposed in a more informal context, such as during hacker conferences.",

QR code provides high data storage capacity, fast scanning, omnidirectional readability, and many other advantages including, error-correction (so that damaged code can also be read successfully) and different type of versions. Different varieties of QR code symbols like logo QR code, encrypted QR code, iQR Code are also available so that user can choose among them according to their need. Now these days, a QR code is applied in different application streams related to marketing, security, academics etc. and gain popularity at a really high pace. Day by day more people are getting aware of this technology and use it accordingly. The popularity of QR code grows rapidly with the growth of smartphone users and thus the QR code is rapidly arriving at high levels of acceptance worldwide.",

    abstractNote= "QR codes, 2-D bar codes that can be read by special software on a smartphone, have been undergoing rapid development. This study examines how a Technology Acceptance Model could predict users’ intentions to continue using QR codes by integrating interactivity and quality motivations as primary determining factors. Although studies have shown interactivity is important to users, not many study have analyzed the mediating influence of interactivity within interactive marketing context. Therefore, the original TAM was expanded to encompass user perceptions of interactivity and quality. The results of this study show that user intentions and behaviors are largely influenced by the perception of the quality of QR codes. In addition, the results of the model show that interactivity is a key behavioral antecedent to the use of QR codes. In the extended model, the moderating and mediating effects of the perceived interactivity on relationships among the variables were found to be significant. The new set of variables is QR code-specific, acting as factors that enhance attitudes and behavioral intentions. Implications of the findings are discussed in terms of construction of a theory of interactivity and provision of practical insights into development of user-centered QR codes.",

    abstractNote= "Now days, Message authentication is an important security tool. But, without some security mechanism, it is difficult to send data in secure manner. Most popular shortest and cheapest textual form of communication is short message service (SMS). Cryptography is the one of the main categories of computer security that converts information from its normal form into an unreadable form by using Encryption and Decryption Techniques. To ensure the security of the texts which is sent, many encryption algorithm are available. This paper will focus on message security and to secure the text data while transmitting in the network. The data which is to be transmitted from sender to receiver in the network must be encrypted using the encrypted algorithm.). Symmetric key algorithm reduces the problem of computational overhead and to the calculation of algorithm and improves the performance of encryption. The proposed paper is to provide more efficient authentication mechanisms for textual data. The proposed review paper presents a review of security techniques for SMS and a performance comparison between most common encryption algorithms like DES, 3DES, RC4, Blowfish and AES (Rijndael).",
